## About

**fr24feed Processor** is a Java application to "process" data generated by *fr24feed*, the application provided by
[Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com) to [feed ADS-B data](https://www.flightradar24.com/build-your-own) into
their network. What "process" might mean isn't yet clear...

## Motivation

An ADS-B receiver has the potential (depending on location and equipment used) to receive many hundreds of messages per
second broadcast from nearby aircraft - an interesting domain and an ideal datasource for playing with/learning about
the processing of streaming data. There's a vague idea of deploying the application in a Docker container on a Raspberry
Pi.

## Requirements

* JDK 1.8

## Building and Testing

Dependency management and building are handled by Gradle, and the Gradle wrapper is provided.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

```bat
gradlew.bat build
```

The build generates a 'fat' jar.

## Usage

The application's main class is `org.codebrewer.fr24feedprocessor.Fr24feedProcessorApplication`.

At present the application can parse messages in the "SBS-1 BaseStation" format and persist them to an embedded H2
database with the GeoDB spatial extension installed.

## Application Monitoring and Runtime Control

Various managed attributes and operations are exposed to JMX and can therefore be viewed and changed using a client such
as `jconsole`. The Spring Boot Actuator can be enabled and provides a large number of informational REST endpoints.

## Acknowledgments

The **fr24feed Processor** project uses [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and is built by
[Gradle](https://gradle.org). It optionally persists data to an embedded [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
database that has the [GeoDB](https://github.com/jdeolive/geodb) extension installed.

**fr24feed Processor** is not associated with Flightradar24 in any way.

# The properties below define a setup that:
#
#  - expects an unsecured PostgreSQL database with various PostGIS extensions
#    to be available on the local host at the default TCP port;
#  - drops and recreates the DB schema on each startup;
#  - expects the fr24feed application to be running on the local host with
#    BaseStation messages available on TCP port 30003;
#  - establishes a connection to the BaseStation message feed at startup;
#  - persists BaseStation messages to the PostgreSQL database.
#
# Values should be changed (or, better, overridden) to suit the environment in
# use.
